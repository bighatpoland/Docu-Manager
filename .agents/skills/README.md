# Agent Skills (Project, Obviously)

Welcome to the sacred vault of project-specific agent wisdom for **Docu-Manager**.  
Yes, this folder. The one we’ll definitely keep organized. Absolutely. Probably.

## Suggested Structure (a.k.a. “Things We Pretend We’ll Maintain”)

- `dms-ui.md` — Where we argue about buttons, spacing, and why *this* shade of gray is “strategic.”
- `data-model.md` — The sacred scroll of document schema, mysterious field meanings, and validation rules nobody reads until production breaks.
- `workflows.md` — The heroic journey of a document: upload → review → approval → archive → existential crisis.
- `release-checklist.md` — A ritual performed before release to summon stability (results not guaranteed).
- `debug-checklist/` — A structured panic-management system for when builds fail, tests cry, or runtime decides to freestyle.
- `refactor-helper/` — “We’re not changing behavior.”  
  (We are absolutely changing everything. But gently.)

## How to Use (In Theory)

1. Add one markdown file per skill area. One. Singular. Not `final_v3_REAL_THIS_ONE.md`.
2. Keep skills short and actionable. If it requires a philosophy degree, it’s too long.
3. Update after every meaningful change.  
   (Yes, that includes “small refactor, no impact.” It always has impact.)
4. For operational skills, use folder-based skills:  
   `<skill>/SKILL.md` + optional `agents/openai.yaml`  
   Because we are professionals.
