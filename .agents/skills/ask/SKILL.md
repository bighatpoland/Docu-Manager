name: ask
description: Use this when the user’s request is underspecified. Ask the minimum clarifying questions needed before writing or editing code.
---

## Workflow
1) Restate the goal in one sentence.
2) Ask up to 3 clarifying questions that unblock implementation.
3) If user says “assume defaults”, list the assumptions and proceed.

## Guardrails
- Do NOT edit files until questions are answered (unless user explicitly authorizes assumptions).
- Keep questions concrete (paths, language/runtime, constraints, acceptance criteria).
