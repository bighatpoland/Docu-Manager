# DMS Prototype

Welcome to a totally calm and definitely-not-overambitious **single-page Document Management System prototype**.

Built for the timeless business dream: _“Can we just upload everything, secure everything, classify everything, and make it look easy?”_

## What this thing does

- Gives users a dashboard and document library so they can feel productive.
- Lets admins manage metadata-based permission rules so chaos is at least policy-driven.
- Includes dossier plan management, because plain folders were apparently too mainstream.
- Supports import/export of dossier plans for DEV/TEST/PROD, so your environments can all be equally confusing in sync.

## Tech stack (aka “it’s a prototype, relax”)

- Plain HTML + JavaScript
- Tailwind via CDN
- Font Awesome icons
- Browser `localStorage` as a tiny fake backend with big dreams

## Why it exists

To quickly validate FA.RT → DMS workflows before anyone commits to enterprise-grade consequences.

## Status

Prototype. Works. Opinionated. Slightly dramatic.

## Local run

1. Open `index.html` in a browser (or use Live Server).
2. Click around confidently.
3. Pretend this was always the plan.

## Disclaimer

This is **not** production-ready software.
It is, however, production-ready enthusiasm.
